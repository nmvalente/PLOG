/* this is a somewhat complex function and we do not present step by step comments.
   alternatively, here is the idea:
   - the pieces are displayed in two rows;
   - each piece has top, numbers and bottom;
   - so each piece row is in fact 3 rows: top, numbers and bottom;
   - to know what to print in each moment, we keep track of the current row R;
   - if R is 0 or 3, we are printing tops, for 1 and 4 we print numbers and the others are bottoms;
   - row 1 also has the player name;
   - we also need to keep track of the current piece numbers N1 and N2;
   - and we need to do it for all three aspects, top, number and bottom;
   - so we have N1T, N2T, N1N, N2N, N1B, N2B;
   - if a piece has already been played, we print spaces in its place;
   - this way, the pieces stay in the same place from beggining to end;
   - to determine if we should change row, we check if the counter C has reached 9;
   - because each row has 9 pieces;
   - we use specific predicates to print tops, numbers and bottoms */
